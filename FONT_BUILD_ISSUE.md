# Build Issue: Google Fonts Network Dependency

## Issue Description
The application build fails when Google Fonts cannot be accessed due to network restrictions or connectivity issues.

## Error Details
```
Failed to compile.
src/app/layout.tsx
`next/font` error:
Failed to fetch `Inter` from Google Fonts.
Failed to fetch `Pacifico` from Google Fonts.
Failed to fetch `Poppins` from Google Fonts.
Failed to fetch `Rubik` from Google Fonts.
```

## Root Cause
- Next.js `next/font/google` tries to fetch fonts at build time
- Network restrictions in certain environments prevent access to fonts.googleapis.com
- No fallback mechanism for offline/restricted environments

## Impact
- Production builds fail in restricted network environments
- CI/CD pipelines may fail
- Development environments with limited internet access affected

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Add Local Font Fallbacks (Recommended)
Download font files and serve them locally as fallbacks

### 2. Use System Fonts in Restricted Environments
Conditionally use system fonts when Google Fonts unavailable

### 3. Preload Fonts
Use `next/font/local` with downloaded font files

### 4. Environment-based Font Loading
Use different font strategies based on environment variables

## Current Workaround
Set `SKIP_FONT_OPTIMIZATION=true` environment variable or use system fonts.
